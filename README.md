# School_District_Analysis


Overview Of Analysis

A data scienctist named Maria reached out to me to assistance in gathering and reporting information on standardized test results and school funding for analysis. Maria needs to help preparing for an upcoming meeting with the School Board and Superintendant. This presentation will help the School Board Members discuss and make stategic decisions for areas of improvement. During this analysis I will be task with agrigating the data based on math and reading scores overall score for each school in the district. In doing so, the superintendant and the school board will be able to make proper budget allotments based on the test scores.



Results

During the original analysis it showed that we needed replaced the incorrect reporting data that was showing for Thomas High schoool. None of the other data was updated. Once the data was corrected the overall scores for both reading and math did increase for Thomas High School. The image shown below demonstrates that Thomas high school is  actually listed with an overall passing score of 90.63 percent.

Once the data had been cleaned up and corrected,  Thomas High school had shown that the overall passing percentage actually was only 90.95 percent. I honestly though that it would turn out to be much higher.

Summary

In conclusion, for each of the other schools listed there wasn't a big difference in their overall percentages for the 9th grade test scores. Even with the schools that had low test scores, I was suprised to see that there wasnt a big difference being shown in the numbers even though Thomas High School did have a slight increase. Removing the data actually showed that there was a decrease in the test scores and percentages. And adding the correct numbers didnt prove a higher increase of numbers. This proves that overall removing the data for the 9th graders at Thomas High School doesnt cause a heavy impact on the overall scores.
